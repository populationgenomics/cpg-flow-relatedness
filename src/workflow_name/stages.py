"""
This file exists to define all the Stages for the workflow.
The logic for each stage should be delegated to a separate file in jobs.

In this repository template I've segregated stages (this file) from jobs (logic). This means that even the most trivial
Stage has it's logic in a separate file. In reality Stages are not likely to consist of single line print statements, so
it's good to enforces strict separation of logic for uniformity.

- A Stage contains the definition of inputs, outputs, and it's place in the workflow DAG (via required_stages)
- A job encapsulates all the logic required to complete the Stage, and is contained in a separate file
- A stage will call its corresponding job to queu operations, and the job will return the Hail Batch Job object(s)

Naming conventions for Stages are not enforced, but a series of recommendations have been made here:

https://cpg-populationanalysis.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ST/pages/185597962/Pipeline+Naming+Convention+Specification

A suggested naming convention for a stages is:
  - PascalCase (each word capitalized, no hyphens or underscores)
  - If the phrase contains an initialism (e.g. VCF), only the first character should be capitalised
  - Verb + Subject (noun) + Preposition + Direct Object (noun)
  e.g. AlignShortReadsWithBowtie2, or MakeSitesOnlyVcfWithBcftools
  - This becomes self-explanatory when reading the code and output folders

Each Stage should be a Class, and should inherit from one of the following base classes within cpg_flow.stage:
  - SequencingGroupStage
  - DatasetStage
  - CohortStage
  - MultiCohortStage
